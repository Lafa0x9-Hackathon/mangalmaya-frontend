# Mangalmaya-Frontend

# Project Setup

Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

Before getting started, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and install it following the appropriate instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: A Project - MANGALMAYA

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to add a project. Run the following command to clone a project using GIT, a tool that simplifies the initial setup:

git clone : https://github.com/Lafa0x9-Hackathon/mangalmaya-frontend.git

This command will create a git repo as mangalmaya-frontend.

Step 3: Running the Project

Navigate to the directory of your project:

```bash
cd mangalmaya-frontend
```

Run the following command to start the application on a development server:

```bash
npm start or npm run dev
```

React will start the development server and automatically open your application in the browser.

Step 4: Exploring the Project Structure

Once your project is up and running, it‚Äôs important to understand its basic structure and main files. Here‚Äôs an overview:

src/main.jsx: This file is the entry point of your React application. It imports the root component and renders it to the DOM.
src/App.jsx: This file contains the root component of your application. You can start building your user interface in this component or create additional components and use them here.
src/components/: This folder is where you can store your reusable components. You can create subfolders to organize your components as needed.

Step 5: Developing Your Application

Now that you have your project set up, you can start developing your application. Here are a few key areas you can explore:

Components: Create reusable components to build the user interface of your application.
State: Use React state to handle and update data in your application.
Routing: Set up routing in your application using React Router to create a route-based navigation.
API Calls: Connect to a backend API and make HTTP calls using libraries like Axios or Fetch.
Styling: Add styles to your components using CSS, Sass, or inline styling libraries like styled-components.
